## Red Teams
```
Red Teams are internal or external entities dedicated to testing the effectiveness of a
security program by emulating the tools and techniques
of likely attackers in the most realistic way possible. The practice is similar,
but not identical to, Penetration Testing, and involves the pursuit
of one or more objectives—usually executed as a campaign.
```


## Blue Teams
```
Blue Teams refer to the internal security team that defends against both real attackers and Red Teams.
Blue Teams should be distinguished from standard security teams in most organizations,
as most security operations teams do not have a mentality of constant vigilance against attack,
which is the mission and perspective of a true Blue Team.
```

## Purple Teams
```
Purple Teams exist to ensure and maximize the effectiveness of the Red and Blue teams.
They do this by integrating the defensive tactics and controls from the Blue Team with the
threats and vulnerabilities found by the Red Team into a single narrative that maximizes both.
Ideally Purple shouldn’t be a team at all, but rather a permanent dynamic between Red and Blue
